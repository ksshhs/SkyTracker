= SkyTracker = 

Code and design files for a motorized barn door tracker for night sky photography.

== Hardware ==
Status: 
* Current mockup should be workable assuming the stepper motor does not change as the design progresses.

Concerns:
* Vibration induced by stepper motor.
* Coupling of stepper motor shaft and threaded rod.
* Power requirements of stepper motor could lead to a last minute stepper motor change.

TODO:
* Measure T-nuts, make sure holes in mounting boards are the correct size.
* Waiting on circuit for the following information:
** Circuit mounting constraints (Size, mounting holes, power supply)

== Circuit Design ==
Status:
* Not started.

Concerns:
* Power consumption of stepper motor, need to create designs to determine alternatives and solutions.
** Power consumption vs. torque, how much torque is going to be required to lower the camera?
** Stepper vs. Servo w/ regards to vibration?
* Power supply battery vs. AC Power, Wattage being consumed by steppers for possible deep cycle battery -> Power Inverter or DC-DC power supply -> Stepper motor supply.

== Software Design ==
Status:
* Not Started.

Requirements:
* Drive stepper at a set rate to match sky rotation
* Quick move modes for moving platform up & down
