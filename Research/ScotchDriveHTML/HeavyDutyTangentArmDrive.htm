During the summer of 1994, Ray Grover, then Director of Observations of the <b>Manchester 
  Astronomical Society</b>, began a project for our members to construct a <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/home.htm">quartz-controlled 
  stepper motor drive</a> for a Scotch-type, barn door camera mounting for short 
  duration wide field astrophotography. His technical knowledge of electronics 
  and expertise in astrophotography lead to a simple but very effective drive 
  system that could also be applied to more advanced mountings. 
<p>

Although my knowledge of electronics was and still is zero, I do have a 
lot of experience in building telescope mountings. I used this together 
with a quart-controlled motor built by Ray to construct the heavy duty 
mounting described here.</p><p>

In  January 1994, I bought a second hand Pentacon 300mm f4 lens. Mine 
was one of four available for less than £100 ($150) each from a local 
binocular and telescope dealer in Stockport, near Manchester. The other 
three were bought by other MAS members including Ray. These are very 
fine lenses with low off-axis distortion and are eminently suited to low
 power astrometric work on comets and asteroids. Unfortunately they are 
also heavy, weighing-in at some 4kg (9lbs) apiece.  Normal camera 
mountings cannot cope with this weight unless they are designed to carry
 telescopes. Ray Grover uses a Super Polaris mounting and gets excellent
 results, but such mountings are expensive. I wanted to build a cheap 
tangent arm drive for mine.</p><p>

For a long time I have believed that it you can go into your local DIY 
store and buy off-the-shelf components to make serviceable astronomical 
equipment. Indeed, it should be possible to over-engineer such one-off 
equipment to improve on that commercially available.  I also hold that 
any telescope or camera mount should be capable of being constructed so 
that it doesn't vibrate or move detectably if touched or even lightly 
knocked during an exposure. My aim was to make a heavy-duty tangent arm 
drive that would allow 15-20 minute exposures ( typically the limit 
under suburban or even semi-rural conditions) with 1000 ISO film, giving
 minimal trailing under poor field conditions of moderate wind 
buffeting, yet transportable and cheap to build.</p><p>

I already had two square iron castings holding self-centering 
double-race ball bearings capable of carrying a 38mm (1.5") shaft. These
 were salvaged from an engineer's scrap box about ten years ago with the
 intention of making a small telescope mounting. The castings are 136mm 
(5.35") square and  I fabricated them into a rigid, roughly cubical unit
 by separating them with 105mm (4.22) lengths of 25mm (1") aluminium 
tubing through which runs 10mm (3/8") threaded rods. These bolt the 
bearing assembly solidly together.<br clear="all"></p><p>

This assembly is held at approximately the correct equatorial angle for 
Manchester, 53.5deg North, by the incorporation of appropriate lengths 
of 25x40mm aluminium channel under the top casting so that the bearing 
unit can be inclined and bolted firmly at the correct angle to the upper
 surface of a triangular box assembly fabricated from 3mm (1/8") 
aluminium plate and 25x40mm aluminium channel. From above, the plan of 
this box assembly is that of a truncated equilateral triangle.  This 
stands on and can be bolted to the triangular top plate of a heavy duty 
tripod that I made using similar kinematic principles, incorporating 
lots of rigid triangles.</p><p>

The polar axis is a 300mm (12") length of 38mm (1.5") OD stainless steel
 tube. An L - shaped declination arm (really a half-fork) was 
constructed from  65mm (2.6") square-section extruded uPVC rainwater 
downspouting and two right-angle mouldings, bought for a few pounds at a
 local DIY store. The arm was initially built using UPVC glue before 
being held onto the polar axis by the judicious use of hose clamps 
around the polar axis, inside the UPVC tube, while the hollow plastic 
was filled with a sloppy cement mixture. When set, this gave a 
rock-solid polar axis / dec. arm assembly.<br clear="all"></p><p> 

The beauty of using cement or concrete in a plastic tube is that the 
rigid but brittle filling is protected by the aesthetically pleasing 
black UPVC tube whilst giving the whole a deadening, vibration damping, 
effect. Although heavy initially, cement eventually dries to give a very
 rigid, but not too heavy structure. Before filling, the UPVC tube was 
drilled for the attachment of a 12mm (0.5") thick aluminium-angle camera
 mounting plate and a slightly smaller secondary camera mounting. These 
are attached to the declination arm with 8mm (1/3") zinc plated bolts 
and wing nuts.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/hdm/drivebox.jpg"><img src="HeavyDutyTangentArmDrive_files/drivebox.gif" align="left" border="0" hspace="20"></a></p><p>

The polar axis and declination arm assembly slides smoothly into the 
bearings and in so doing traps the tangent drive arm. This is a 
composite structure made from 25x25mm aluminium channel and a piece of 
scrap, 1" thick oak. The expanded upper end of the tangent arm fits 
around the polar axis and is held by the downward force of the heavy 
declination arm. The drive arm is trapped between the top of the upper 
bearing and a rough plywood disk which acts as a friction clutch beneath
 the declination arm. I can manually slew the mounting in RA to any part
 of the sky and then start the stepper motor drive to give good tracking
 motion with nothing other than this friction. The tangent arm can be 
clamped to the polar axis if needed but in practice it has been found 
that the friction disk is sufficient.<br clear="all"></p><p>

The quartz controlled stepper motor is driven by a 12 volt automobile 
battery bought from a scrap dealer for £5 ($8). The motor drives the 
mounting at approximately sidereal rate and after the desired exposure 
is finished, a reversing switch on the control box allows the motor to 
rewind the screw at x8 sidereal rate. The stepper motor and electronics 
control box containing the quartz oscillator, an on-off switch and the 
motor reversing switch  are mounted on a piece of 6mm (1/4") aluminium 
angle, which also carries a small limit switch, mounted on a stalk, to 
stop the motor after rewinding.</p><p>

Ray Grover described the geometry of the Scotch tangent arm drive in his
 article. The 1rev per 50 second motor is attached to a tangent arm of 
about 348mm ( 13.71") radius driven by a 20 TPI threaded steel rod. A 
reasonably accurate sidereal rate results. Pivoted at one end, as in the
 classic Scotch drive, the 'tangent error' causes a rapid loss of drive 
accuracy as the drive slows down compared to the uniform motion of the 
sky.  However in Ray's mounting, the drive screw is pivoted at both ends
 to minimise this effect. This results in the drive rate speeding up 
slightly due to a reversed, but minimised, residual tangent error. I 
have included an <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/hdm/spreadsheet.zip">Excel spreadsheet</a> showing the calculations involved. It is also reproduced below.<br clear="all"></p><p>

My mounting differs somewhat from the standard Scotch drive, and Ray's, 
in that at commencement of the exposure, with the drive screw fully 
rewound, the motor drive point is offset  some  60mm (2.36") from the 
threaded brass pivot at the end of the tangent arm. Note that a brass 
pivot, through which passes the steel screw, was chosen because 
dissimilar metals tend not to bind. The pivot at the motor end is 
affected by connecting the drive screw to the motor spindle with a short
 length of silicone rubber tubing fastened on with twisted wire ties. 
The effect of the aforementioned offset (which should be reduced if 
possible) is that the camera moves rather faster, and increasingly so, 
than the sky rotates. This can be compensated by slightly increasing the
 length of the tangent arm - my arm is ajustable - so that the drive 
initially runs slow and then fast so that the overall effect is a modest
 drive inaccuracy over the duration of the exposure.  Appendix 1, 
calculated in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, shows the effect of this 
residual error. In practice, even the 300mm f4 lens is insensitive to 
it; halation in the film's emulsion masks the driving error.</p><p>

Polar alignment is very important, as with any equatorial mounting, and 
time should be spent to give the best overall accuracy. Polar alignment 
is aided in my mounting by the incorporation of a x4 telescopic rifle 
sight in the tubular polar axis. Using short focal length lenses 
alignment is not critical and even with the 300mm I have found that 
sighting Polaris through the alignment telescope and offsetting 
appropriately is sufficiently accurate to allow 20 minute exposures 
without any noticeable trailing.  Polaris is found in the telescope by 
the trial and error manoeuvring of the tripod facilitated by the 
adjustable south leg that allows about ten degrees of latitude to be 
accommodated.</p><p>


To date, apart from minor problems with the battery holding its charge, 
the drive has performed very well. The cost excluding the bearings was 
about £60 ($100) in 1995. The design, illustrated in the pictures 
supplied by Mike Oates, can be recommended. Please let me know if you 
want further information. Conversely, how did you build a cheap camera 
drive?</p><p>
