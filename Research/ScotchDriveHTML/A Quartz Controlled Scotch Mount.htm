<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Scotch mount, also called the Haig or barn door mount, has been around for 
many years, and has allowed amateurs to produce photographs of the night sky simply 
and cheaply. The addition of a quartz controlled stepper motor increases the utility 
at a modest cost. The circuit described can also be used for driving a telescope. 
<p> 
</p><h2>Basics of the Scotch Mount</h2>
Two boards are hinged together along one edge. The boards are driven apart by 
a screwed rod. If the screw is turned at the right rate then the top board will 
follow the movement of the stars in the sky, providing the hinge axis is aimed 
at the North or South pole. In effect the screwed rod serves the same purpose 
as the worm and wheel used to drive a scope. The rod is turned by hand in the 
simplest version, but can be motorised quite easily. If a quartz controlled stepper 
motor is used the error due to the drive rate of the rod can be eliminated. The 
other sources of error can be reduced substantially by careful design and construction. 
<p> <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/fixed.gif"><img src="A%20Quartz%20Controlled%20Scotch%20Mount_files/fixed.gif" border="0"></a><br>
  The main tracking error occurs because the screwed rod is straight, unlike the 
  "thread" on the circumference of a worm wheel. In the simplest version the rod 
  is fixed at one end at right angles to the lower board and the top end slides 
  along the top board as the angle increases. The drive slows down as the angle 
  increases because the distance between the point of contact and the hinge is 
  getting longer. 
</p><p> <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/pivot.gif"><img src="A%20Quartz%20Controlled%20Scotch%20Mount_files/pivot.gif" border="0"></a><br>
  However if the screwed rod is pivoted at each end the error is much reduced, 
  being only due to the fact that the rod forms a chord rather than an arc. In 
  this case the drive speeds up with time, but for short exposures (e.g. 10 mins) 
  the error is very small. The deviations from a true drive rate can be expressed 
  in arc seconds for an elapsed time, assuming the boards are together at the 
  start. 
</p><p> <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/graph.gif"><img src="A%20Quartz%20Controlled%20Scotch%20Mount_files/graph.gif" border="0"></a><br>
  For example with the improved design the deviation after 10 minutes is only 
  0.7 arc seconds, increasing to 6 arc seconds after another 10 minutes. These 
  are quite low values, and in practice there will be other factors which limit 
  the tracking accuracy. These are estimated and compared later. 
</p><p> 
</p><h2>The Quartz Controlled Motor Circuit</h2>
The circuit makes use of standard CMOS logic IC's and a stepper motor driver IC. 
The motor is a twelve volt 200 step unipolar motor obtained secondhand for about 
12 pounds. All the other parts can be obtained from <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/">Maplin</a> 
or <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/circuit.htm#sup">similar suppliers</a> for about 13 pounds. A <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/circuit.htm"><b>circuit 
diagram and parts list</b></a> with the Maplin catalogue numbers is included. 
The circuit runs from a twelve volt battery, and consumes about a quarter of an 
amp. 
<p> The operation of the circuit is as follows. The 4060 IC is a combined oscillator 
  and divider chip. The quartz crystal oscillates at 4.194304 MHz, and this frequency 
  is divided down by 2 in 20 stages to give the 4 Hz rate to drive the stepper 
  motor. As this is a 200 step motor one complete turn takes 50 seconds. (Not 
  one minute as in many traditional designs!). The frequency division is performed 
  partly by the 4060 and completed by the 4024 divider chip. The 4 Hz frequency 
  is taken from output 5 via a switch to the clock input of the <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/saa1027.htm"><b>SAA 
  1027 stepper motor control IC.</b></a> This IC has 4 open collector transistor 
  outputs which send current to the motor windings. The current is limited by 
  the 220 ohm resistor which controls the base current of the output transistors. 
  Since the screwed rod has to be returned to its starting position after each 
  exposure a reversing circuit and stop switch are provided. When the switch SW3 
  is in the reverse position the motor is driven rapidly back at 8 times the forward 
  rate by using the 32 Hz signal from output 2 of the 4024 IC. At the same time 
  the direction is reversed by switching the M pin of the <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/saa1027.htm">SAA 
  1027</a> IC from ground to 12 volts. When the boards come together again the 
  32Hz signal is interrupted by the stop switch SW2 which is of the "push to break" 
  type. This can be mounted on the lower board. 
</p><p> Some smoothing and decoupling capacitors are used to reduce noise, and a diode 
  prevents damage if the battery is connected the wrong way round. The IC's should 
  not be subjected to more than 15 volts, so the power source should be a 12 volt 
  lead acid battery, a string of 10 NiCads, or a regulated supply of 12 volts. 
  Unregulated sources such as mains adaptors or battery chargers should not be 
  used to drive the circuit directly. 
</p><p> The battery I use is a 12 v sealed lead acid battery of 6.5 Amp hour capacity. 
  I have used it in freezing conditions without problems. The circuit only draws 
  about 0.25 amps so there is enough capacity to run other things as well. I often 
  use a heater to go around the lens to prevent water condensing on it. That takes 
  another 0.2 amp approximately. This battery is about 100 x 150 x 80 mms in size. 
  The battery can be used in any position. I guess it is the same type you refer 
  to for use in burglar alarms. 
</p><p> Construction of the circuit should be straightforward, e.g. on matrix board. 
  Take precautions against static damage to the two CMOS IC's. The IC's are best 
  mounted in sockets and fitted when the other construction is complete. The whole 
  board can be fitted into a plastic box of small size, with flying leads to the 
  motor and stop switch. The box can be conveniently fixed to the front or underside 
  of the lower board. 
</p><p> The LED shows when the circuit is powered and working. It flashes twice a 
  second. When the circuit has been built this provides a first check that it 
  is operating correctly. In my experience of making ten of these circuits I have 
  found two causes of malfunction. Most common is a mistake in the wiring especially 
  of the components around the crystal, which tend to be crammed together. Once 
  I had a crystal which refused to oscillate. A second one worked perfectly when 
  wired in. 
</p><p> 
</p><h2>The Mechanical Construction</h2>
This is left quite open, to suit individual skills and requirements. Some particular 
points are important though. The screwed rod should be tightly coupled to the 
motor shaft to ensure it turns at the correct rate. Since the rod must pivot at 
both ends, the motor cannot be rigidly fixed to the lower board unless some form 
of universal joint is used. This can be nothing more than a piece of rubber tubing 
which is a push fit over the motor shaft and the screwed rod. Alternatively the 
motor can be pivoted in two bearings and the rod rigidly attached to the shaft. 
<p> The thread can be chosen to be the same or a different size to the motor shaft, 
  in my case 1/4 inch for both. With the common Whitworth thread the pitch is 
  20 per inch. Since the rod turns once every 50 seconds the distance from the 
  axis of the hinge to the centre of the rod for the right opening rate can be 
  calculated as 348.3 mm. The calculation is shown in the figure. 
</p><p> <b>Calculation of hinge to rod distance for Scotch drive.</b> 
</p><p> Rotation rate required is one turn per 23 hours 56 minutes 
</p><p> 
</p><ul>
  <pre>This is 2 pi radians in 1436 minutes

Or a rate of 2*pi/1436 radians per minute

If the pitch of the screw is x mm and one turn takes place in 50 seconds
then the nut is driven along the rod at a rate of (x*60/50)mm per minute

If the distance to the hinge is L mm then the angular rate is...
	(x/L*60/50) radians per minute

Setting this equal to the required rate:

	x/L*60/50 = 2*pi/1436
or	L = (x*60/50*1436)/(2*pi)


</pre>
</ul>
<b>The table below shows some common threads and the hinge to rod distance which 
is needed.</b> 
<p> 
</p><pre>	<b>Threaded rod         Pitch           Pitch      Hinge to pivot distance
	                                     mm              mm</b>

	1/4 inch whitworth   20 per inch     1.2700           348.3
	3/8 inch Whitworth   16 per inch     1.5875           435.4
	M6 metric            10 per cm.      1.0000           274.3
	M8 metric             8 per cm.      1.2500           342.8

</pre>
In practice the actual thread can deviate substantially from these correct values. 
It is worth measuring the pitch, e.g. by counting and marking 100 threads and 
then measuring the distance. If the thread is not exactly right the hinge to rod 
distance given above can be modified to suit. E.g. if there are 1% more threads 
per inch than there should be then reduce the distance by the same amount of 1%. 
When going to the trouble of providing an accurate quartz drive it is sensible 
to reduce the other errors as much as possible. 
<p> The upper end of the rod runs in a threaded bush which is pivoted in the top 
  board. This could simply be a nut, but having a longer length of thread in contact 
  with the rod will reduce slop in the system and also any errors due to periodic 
  variations in the pitch of the rod.

  <p> 
</p></ul>
<h2>Polar Alignment</h2>
A small telescope should be fixed to the top board parallel to the hinge, in order 
to view the pole star (assuming operation in the Northern Hemisphere). This scope 
should have a cross hair or reticle fitted. The diagram shows a scope made from 
an old binocular objective and a low power eyepiece fitted with a reticle. Alternatively 
a rifle scope is ideal and can be bought cheaply. A modest power and aperture, 
e.g. 6 x 20 are sufficient. 
<p> <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/polscope.gif"><img src="A%20Quartz%20Controlled%20Scotch%20Mount_files/polscope.gif" border="0"></a><br>
  Some adjustment of the direction of the scope is needed so that it can be aligned 
  with the hinge. The alignment can then be made by clamping the lower board and 
  viewing a small very distant object. The object is first centred on the cross 
  hair or reticle by moving the boards together with the top board in the down 
  position. Then when the top board is hinged upwards the object should remain 
  centred in the cross hair. If it moves the scope position should be adjusted 
  left/right, or up/down, until the movement during this test is eliminated. 
</p><p> The Pole star is not located exactly at the celestial pole, so for good tracking 
  the cross hairs should be offset by 44 minutes, i.e. about 3/4 of a degree from 
  the star. This distance can be set on a reticle, or simply judged from the field 
  of view of the scope. For example if the field is a total of three degrees then 
  placing the star half way between the edge and the cross hairs will give the 
  right offset of 3/4 of a degree. 
</p><p> The direction of the Pole Star away from the true pole is Right Ascension 
  2 hours 31.8 minutes. However this direction is not obvious! An easy way to 
  fix the direction uses the fact that the next brightest star of Ursa Minor, 
  Kochab or Beta Ursa Minoris, lies almost exactly in the opposite direction. 
  By alternately looking at the positon of this star and the view through the 
  scope Polaris can be offset from the centre in the right direction. 
</p><p> <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/polaris2.gif"><img src="A%20Quartz%20Controlled%20Scotch%20Mount_files/polaris2.gif" border="0"></a><br>
  If the scope is a direct viewing type like a rifle scope, Polaris should be 
  on the other side of the cross hairs to Kochab. However if the scope is an astronomical 
  type which gives an upside down image then Polaris should be placed on the same 
  side as Kochab.

</p><h2>Sources of Tracking Error</h2>
The error from the basic design has already been shown. Other sources of error 
are: 
<p> 
</p><ul>
  <li>From inaccuracies of the Polar alignment 
  </li><li>Due to an inaccurate drive rate from the electronics 
  </li><li>From error in the pitch of the screw 
  </li><li>Due to poor mechanical stability of the system 
</li></ul>
The first three of these can be estimated. The effect of misalignment of the axis 
with respect to the true pole depends on the location of the object being photographed. 
The worst case is for an object on the celestial equator. This is also true for 
the other sources, so in the following calculations it is assumed that the objects 
we want to photograph are placed there. The table shows the trailing that will 
occur, in minutes of arc, from misalignments of 0 to 100 arc minutes, for drive 
times up to 60 minutes. A misalignment of 10 arc minutes is probably the best 
that could be achieved with the system described, and for an exposure of 10 minutes 
would result in a tracking error of 0.44 arc minutes or 26 arc seconds.

</pre>
The quartz crystal clock controlling the drive rate of the motor should be accurate 
to 100 parts per million (ppm) or better. The table shows what effect this clock 
rate error, and some larger ones, would have. So for our 10 minute exposure example 
a clock accurate to 100 ppm gives a problem of only 0.9 arc seconds (the least 
of our worries!). 
<p> 
</p><pre><b>Drive rate accuracy	Total angle    Drive rate error(arcsecs)

	10		   9000		 90	 9	0.9
	20		  18000		180	18	1.8
	30		  27000		270	27	2.7


</pre>
The pitch of the screw can be obtained manually by the method described above. 
For example if we could measure to 0.5 mm over the length needed i.e. 5 inches 
or 125 mm that would be 0.4%. Let's suppose that we can do rather better than 
that and measure the actual pitch to 0.1%. Then the tracking error resulting can 
be read from the previous table, i.e. 9 arc seconds for a 10 minute exposure. 
<p> The mechanical stabilty of the system will obviously affect the tracking. 
  The best situation would be a permanent set up on a solid base as for a telescope. 
  In that case the alignment could also be refined until it was spot on. Most 
  users will probably want to have a portable system though, mounted on a camera 
  tripod for example. Unless this is particularly rigid it will have some movement, 
  e.g. from gusts of wind or from flexure from the weight of camera and lens. 
  This is difficult to estimate, but experience from the design and use of tripods 
  for telescopes is very relevant - the more rigid the better. 
</p><p> A summary of the errors that have been calculated are shown in the table. 
  In order to assess the importance of these we need to know what is tolerable. 
  If we use a short exposure with a normal 50mm lens we don't need nearly as much 
  accuracy as a long time with a telephoto. Let's suppose that we would like a 
  resolution of 40 lines per mm on our film. This corresponds to features that 
  are 25 microns in size in the emulsion. We want to limit any trailing of the 
  stars to 25 microns or less. 
</p><p> The diagram then shows what this trailing corresponds to in seconds of arc 
  for lenses of different focal lengths. So for a 50 mm. standard lens the movement 
  allowed would be 103 arc seconds. But when we go to a 500 mm telephoto we can 
  only tolerate 10 arc seconds of deviation if we are to keep the trailing to 
  25 microns. 
</p><p> <b>Accuracy of tracking required</b><br>
  <a href="http://www.mikeoates.org/mas/projects/scotch/accuracy.gif"><img src="A%20Quartz%20Controlled%20Scotch%20Mount_files/accuracy.gif" border="0"></a><br>
  A = r / F x 360 / (2 x pi) x 60 x 60 
</p><p> A good resolution is 40 lines per mm on the film. This means a movement of 
  0.025 mm or less.<br>
  For a lens of focal lenght F: 
</p><pre>		F	A
		50	103
		135	38
		300	17
		500	10
</pre>
When we put all these figures together we can estimate the exposures that our 
simple Scotch mount is capable of making. The biggest error turns out to be due 
to the Polar alignment (or lack of it). With a 10 minute exposure we would get 
about 26 arc seconds trailing, which would allow us to use a lens of about 200 
mm focal length. But if we go to a half hour shot we would have to limit ourselves 
to a standard lens. 
<p> 
</p><pre>	<b>Summary of errors		  Exposure time 
	in arc seconds</b>
					10	20	30  mins	
	Scotch mount(pivoted)		 0.7	 6	20
	Polar alignment (10 arcmins)	26	52	79
	Drive rate/pitch (0.1%)		 9	18	27
	Mechanical stability		 ?	 ?	 ?

	Usable lens			200	80	50  mm
	Usable lens (non-critical)	500	200	135 mm

</pre>
These figures are for the worst case of objects near the celestial equator. Objects 
near the pole are more forgiving. Also in some situations a bit of trailing would 
not matter much, e.g. if trying to catch meteors. In these "non-critical" cases 
the lens could be a longer focal length.
